# ProjectMark backend assessment

## Overview

Build a RESTful API for a Dynamic Knowledge Base System. This system should manage interconnected topics and resources with version control, user roles, and permissions. The challenge will assess the candidateâ€™s ability to implement complex business logic, use advanced OOP concepts, design patterns, and algorithms, as well as maintain high code quality and testing standards.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
    - SQLlite is being used, this requires node@22 and is set to use in memory state

```sh
npm install
```

3. Build the project:

```sh
npm run build
```

4. Run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Authentication

The application uses a mocked authentication system for development purposes. To authenticate requests, include a `fake_auth` header with one of the following values:

- `admin`: Full access to all endpoints
- `editor`: Can create, read, update and delete content
- `viewer`: Can only read content (default if no header is provided)

Example:

```
fake_auth: admin
```

## API Routes

The Postman collection for testing API endpoints can be found within the project directory

## Running Tests

The project includes both unit tests and integration tests. Run them with:

```sh
npm test
```

## Development

Start the development server with hot-reloading:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Code formatting and linting:

```sh
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix
npm run pretty
```
